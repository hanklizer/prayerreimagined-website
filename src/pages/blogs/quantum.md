## Why Did Consciousness Emerge?


Donald Hoffman is a cognitive psychologist and popular science author as well as college professor of Cognitive Sciences and also holds joint appointments in the Department of Philosophy, the Department of Logic and Philosophy of Science, and the School of Computer Science. Hoffman has taken on a challenging topic: Why did consciousness emerge?‚Äù He argues for consciousness being fundamental not the Big Bang having starting it all, not space and time nor physical objects. He states evolution in humans is the interface that has enabled us to navigate effectively throughout our environments much as a computer screen, its interface, enables the computer user to easily navigate and accomplish various tasks. The analogy holds when you consider just behind that screen is hidden the various electronic components and processes from us not necessary to know to accomplish the task. Compare that to mankinds evolutionary interface, mentioned previously, theorized as its purpose is to enable humankind's fitness and survival. How is this done? It is by limiting our perceptual capabilities; that is we require only to have awareness of the things we need to know with the 'rest' being hidden. Again, the concept is that all information is necessarily partial and focused as we formulate a concise question thus enabling our consciousness to determine only the information that we need. So what is the  description of what lays behind this evolutionary interface? Hoffman says it is Consciousness, the omnipotent kind the one spelled with a capital 'C'. To see everything as a whole we would need an unlimited consciousness. And that is what many people call God.
