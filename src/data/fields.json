		"content": "There is intriguing evidence that suggests the human brain conforms to quantum processes giving rise to consciousness. Quantum entanglement could be a real phenomena in the brain and not explainable by classical physics. As experimentation continues and if this is the case, this could begin to shed light on how our brain performs the powerful computations it does, and how it manages consciousness. "

		"description": "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet",
		"content": "Intention isn't just an idea it can also be thought of as a force. If we then imagine beliefs and intentions are able to energize the field then it would seem these real energies are capable of  molding our reality. Present day quantum pioneers describe that upon the observation of the quantum field, a response occurs to our active attention. There will follow the collapsing of the vast array of possibilities into the one that aligns with our focus. Consciousness merges with the quantum fabric, a determinate  of our destiny."

		"description": "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet",
		"content": "One of the most difficult quantum concepts to grasp is entanglement. It is what Einstein called spooky action at a distance. Strange indeed if you consider that when you measure something about one particle (electrons or photons for example) in an entangled pair, immediately you will know something about the other particle, even if they are millions of light years apart. This odd connection between the two particles is instantaneous."

		"description": "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet",
		"content": "Reiki is a Japanese word derived from Usui Reiki Ryoho meaning universal life force energy. It is said that the reiki practioner generates strong vibrations of Universal energy (at the quantum scale) from his/her body to influence weaker vibrations directed towards the recipients body. This it is said will bring about a more healthful state of being. Another component of reiki is supposedly from the mental intention that's channeled for  the benefit of the recipient. It should be noted that typical for the practitioner is the placement of hands on or just above the body."

From a scientific perspective the chakra system is compatible with quantum physics theory if it's approached as nodal points where consciousness and matter intersect."

One experiment of note was in 2003 designed by Katherine Creath and Gary E. Schwartz https://neurology.arizona.edu/gary-e-schwartz-phd of the University of Arizona Center for Consciousness Studies pursuing evidence of entanglement between human and plant systems. Human consciousness intention was focused upon 4600 okra and zucchini seeds in petri dishes within a suitable growth chamber as follows. There were ten periods of intention focus  for a duration of 15-20 minutes twice daily that produced statistically significant faster germination results."

It encompasses several scientific disciplines including quantum physics https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics , chemistry, quantum field theory, quantum technology, and quantum information science. It is here within this mix where researchers are exploring whether consciousness can be explained in terms of quantum physics. The main idea is that consciousness can be defined as one's self-awareness and their impact upon his/hers surroundings. Quantum mechanics has demonstrated that when a measurement is taken the indeterminate/infinite possibilities that exist as potential collapse a wave https://plus.maths.org/content/physics-minute-double-slit-experiment-0 This creates or determines a definite, concrete outcome we call reality."
