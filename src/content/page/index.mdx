          ### Prayer


          Does prayer at a distance work? An important paper was released on June 6, 2000 in the Annals of Internal Medicine entitled
                            The Efficacy of "Distant Healing': A Systematic Review of Randomized Trials. It stated 57% of clinical trials showed a positive treatment effect.
                            It concluded evidence suggests there is 'something' causing a healing influence needing more research.

## Prayer Reimagined 

Prayer a word made of just six letters yet it encompasses at least five thousand years of human history, voluminous troves of biblical accounts, stories, anecdotal information and much more. Also known as petitionary prayer, it has been the bedrock of faith turned to by
humankind in good times and in bad. There also is another type of prayer called intercessory prayer and the theme of the prayer reimagined website. Intercessory prayer defined as the act of praying on behalf of others that has been the subject of scientific investigation since 1872. Prayer Reimagined takes a deep dive into the idea of healing at a distance and the latest data including quantum physics research. A great starting place is an understanding of intent, a component of prayer.
